I this subfolder there will be the elaboration of the results of the calculated times 
for half-mass radius mediated quantities of all (or quite a bit less) 166 GCs present
in Baumgardt database online (see global README).
We first do a calculus of time but now the results are themself the data (with an
opportune format and extension ".risdat") there are going to be elaborated to do, for example, 
calculus of correlation with the compactness index or other quantities.
